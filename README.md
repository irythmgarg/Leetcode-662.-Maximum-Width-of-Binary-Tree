# Leetcode-662.-Maximum-Width-of-Binary-Tree
# 📏 Maximum Width of a Binary Tree 🌳

This project computes the **maximum width** of a binary tree at any level using a smart index-based BFS approach.  
Width is measured between the **leftmost** and **rightmost** non-null nodes at each level — including the gaps! 🧠📐

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Traverses the tree level-by-level using **Breadth-First Search** (BFS)  
- Tracks node positions using index simulation as if it were a complete binary tree 🧮  
- Efficiently computes the maximum width across all levels in the tree 🔍

## 📊 Time and Space Complexity

| Operation           | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| BFS Traversal 🌀    | O(n)             | O(n)             |

- **n** = total number of nodes in the binary tree  
- Position indices are normalized to avoid overflow due to deep trees
